#Overview

**This page is still under construction, while the upgrade list is complete, there are still enhancements queued, like the upgraded item to the right, and will show the stat difference between the original item, and the list of your equipment on how many you have of each one.**

*Red equipment means you cannot do this upgrade, either you do not have this item, or you do not have any of the required ships. Please don't ask "why are things enabled when I don't even have an Akashi".*

Currently the days of the week is shown on the top followed by the equipments as well the respective ships that can be used in conjunction for improvement.

Current day of the week is automatically selected, however other days of the week can also be viewed simply by clicking.
