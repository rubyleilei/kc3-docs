    -   **MN:** Midnight (12:00am or 000hrs)
    -   The formats are indicated in 12hours
-   **Over the past week (per 6 hours)**
    -   The formats are indicated in 24hours
-   **Over the past month (per day)**
    -   The formats are indicated as Month/Day

You can hover your mouse over each of the nodes (as indicated as dots on the graph) to see your consumables at a certain point when KC3 Kai captured the details of your consumables.
