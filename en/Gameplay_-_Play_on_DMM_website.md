**Direct DMM website** is an option on how you can play KanColle with KC3改.

This was originally made for our cautious group of friends whom were concerned about the safety and does not playing via API links, nor iframes. This means also that this is the absolutely the safest way to play the game:

-   Your API Link is always updated due to the fact that you chose the option of "Play on DMM Website" which ensures your API link will be reset everytime you choose that option.
-   It is also the way the KanColle originally was designed and therefore intended to be played by DMM.

Gameplay Mechanism
------------------

Selecting "Play on DMM Website" on the menu only opens a new tab, with a HTML file within KC3改. The game is not open at this point. Game client is not open and there is no call to the servers yet. At this point we just opened a file within your computer, included in the KC3改 package (`web.html`).

On the opened page, you will be shown instructions on how to optionally open "[Admiral Dashboard](Panel "wikilink")". This admiral dashboard, or commonly known as "F12 panel", or just "panel", is the one showing you fleet statuses on real-time, timers, totals like ELoS (Equipment Line of Sight), AFP, morale, etc.

After you've opened the Admiral Dashboard, you will be automatically be
redirected to the DMM website to play.

Alternatively, you can click the "Start the game now" button to proceed to the game without bothering about the "Admiral Dashboard". This will redirect you to the DMM website to play.

After you're directed to DMM website, everything is how its supposed to be, playing how its meant to be played. No on-screen translations, no iframes, etc. See [Reading your data](Reading_your_data "wikilink") article to know more about how we know your data even if you're on DMM.

FAQ
---

### Why need an extra intro page before directing to DMM website?

Think of it as a spoon-feed for new players who don't know how this works, and how to open the **Admiral Dashboard**. For everyone at least, this page is also the perfect time to open it since we need the panel open at the very start of your game. Opening the panel too late in the middle of a gameplay session will not ensure that data is updated.

Things like equipment list and construction timers are loaded at the start of the game.

### Where did "Play via DMM Frame" go?

Starting v010, playing via DMM will be done directly on the DMM netgame portal website itself. There will be no more DMM frames with custom backgrounds, etc.

**Reason:** Play via DMM is made for our overly cautious group of friends who still worry about safety. Playing it on a frame, with backgrounds and translations, defeats its purpose. Who of us worries about safety that much but still applies customizations and uses an iframe? Therefore DMM gameplay will only be at the DMM website itself, which as mentioned, is meant for the cautious.

If you still wanna use custom backgrounds, go use [API links](Gameplay_-_API_Link "wikilink")
