#Overview

**Currently this feature works for http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki users as it relies on a specific set of templates as well as the mediawiki framework.**

The export function allows you to export your current fleet setup to others. Handy for when you want to present your fleet configuration for presentation without having to know much about the wikicode.
