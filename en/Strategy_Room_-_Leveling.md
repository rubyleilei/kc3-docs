##Overview
This section allows you to preset your leveling goals for your ships, as well once set it will show you approximately how many more runs is needed to achieve the goal from the KC3 Kai panel.

Once preset for the ship(s), under the Current Goals section the information will be displayed as follows (from left to right):
   - The name of the ship. Followed by the type of ship on the bottom of the name.
   - Level: The current level in which the ship is at within your game profile.
   - Goal: The set level for your desired ship that you intend to level to.
   - Battles: The amount of battles required (theoretically speaking) based on the various conditions that you have set. Factors that may impede on the actual amount of battles required generally involve (but are not limited to):
     - Whether or not if this ship was set as flagship within the game.
     - Whether or not if this ship attained MVP after the sortie.
     - Wether or not you have sortied to the area in which you intend to level the ship.
   -  Map: The set area for your desired ship that you intend to level at.
   -  Rank: The set rank you wish to have your ship attaining. This *affects* the amount of actual runs required.
   -  FS: Whether or not if you have chosen for your desired ship to be the flagship or not.  This *affects* the amount of actual runs required.
   -  MVP: Whether or not if you have chosen for your desire ship to acquire the MVP status or not.  This *affects* the amount of actual runs required.
