FAQ

#### All my data was missing/cleared!

Did you re-install? If so that is unfortunate. Chrome clears you data if the extension was un-installed, and a re-install is basically the same as un-install and install process.

**Is there any way to get my data back?** Short answer is no and especially if you have either been:
* using developmental versions even though it is noted that you will end up pulling your hair out.
* you did not bother backing up your progress history which is already somewhat available through the Strategy Room.

but long answer is maybe. Now go play and start building your game history once again!

**Are there any plans to fix this?**

-   One, it ain't a bug.
-   Second, you're right we still need to address this. There are plans to implement data migration feature, and even device sync features.
-   Third, for now if you insist on recovering your data back at all costs. It is probably time to look into data recovery softwares that are out there in the market and hope that you have not overwritten the area where your history with KC3 Kai is still available, either in part or full.

That's so far ahead into the future though, better take a ride with [Marty McFly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_McFly).

#### It says "No player data available"

Then you probably haven't played the game with the [F12 panel / Admiral Dashboard](https://github.com/KC3Kai/kc3-docs/tree/master/en/Panel.md "wikilink") enabled. Play first and wait til you get to the home screen, where your secretary is.

**But, I thought it would have my entire history of KanColle game session since I first started!**

No, KC3 Kai does not and cannot obtain your historical events when you first started playing KanColle. Neither does KanColle game itself would actually store your history on the server publicly.

**I was using KCV, KCT, EO, Poi, etc and I thought those information would also be shared with my KC3 Kai session(s)!**

First off, those other viewers are developed and maintained by different entities which has **no** affiliation with KC3 Kai and/or its respective developers. So, the way these other viewers store and present their data to their users vary greatly with KC3 Kai and the way KC3 Kai itself stores and presents its data.

Second, there are no plans to make player's data cross-compatible between various viewers.

Last but not least, KanColle servers does **not** store your KanColle history anywhere on the server that is accessible via viewers. Not without hacking which ultimately involves tarnishing both the viewer's image as well as risking your account in being banned.
