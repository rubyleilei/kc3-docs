Overview
--------

Regular Maps presents a log of user's historical sorties **when** the user uses KC3 Kai to interact with the game.

In other words it will **not** show all of the user's historical sorties from ever since the user started playing the game **and** without using KC3 Kai. Also it will **not** show resource nodes or dead end nodes.

The information is organized as follows from top to bottom, left to right:

-   All Runs or World #
-   Page number for navigation. Each page only contains 19 sorties per page.
-   Sortie number (only counts when the user uses KC3 Kai to interact with the game)
-   Date (Month/Day format)
-   Ship girls that were sent.
-   Nodes logged (node letterings shown within KC3 Kai may not be the same as the node letterings offered on other sites).

The following buttons are as follows (from left to right):
-   F (for fleet)
-   N (for nodes)
-   E (for enemy and their formation)
-   C (for conditions of the battle)
-   A (for Air Battle stats)

Clicking on the button labelled "F" will show more information such as:

-   **Main fleet**: in the format of ships used in the order from flagship to the last ship. Only icons of the ships are represented.
-   **Escorts**: in the format of ships used in the order from flagship to the last ship. This field is **only** visible within Events tab.
-   **Supports**: in the format of ships used in the order from flagship to the last ship. This field is **only** visible when the user has used support expeditions for either World 5 (via expedition 33) or events.
-   **Boss Sup**: in the format of ships used in the order from flagship to the last ship. This field is **only** visible when the user has used boss support expeditions for either World 5 (via expedition 34) or events.

Clicking on the button laballed "N" will show more information such as:

-   **Node letter.**
-   Chosen fleet formation for that node.

    -   **S**,

-   **Support**: Shows whether or not have you used support fleets (via support expeditions).
-   Enemy fleet formation for that node.
-   Enemy fleet composition for that node.

    -   Failed detection, e.g. scout plane shot down (**NO in red letters**)
    -   Enemy fleet detection ok, (**OK in green letters**), or
    -   Enemy fleet detected in possibly better ways in conjunction with certain scouting equipments such as radar or sonar (**OK+ in green letters**).

Questions and answers:
----------------------

**Question: I see the node letters does not correspond to the node letters shown on other sites or even on the maps itself!**

**Answer:** This was covered above, the node letters are **internally referenced** that is they do not necessarily correspond with whatever node letter that was given from other sites/sources.

**Question: I noticed there was a drop for a particular node, but I never got that ship!**

**Answer:** Your ship slots are probably full at the time of that sortie. If and when that happens any result of the ship that was dropped would have been recorded into KC3 Kai **however** because your ship slots were full at the time of that sortie you will not get the ship as a result.

**Question: I am browsing through my sortie history and for certain sorties I have used support fleets. However they do not show up as such. Why is that?**

**Answer:** This is a known bug with KC3 kai and it affects event maps for instance where the user had to rely on supports, boss supports or even escort fleet. In some cases, the extra fields may be shown if the user for instance backs out via clicking on other tab before clicking back onto the relevant tab and relevant section **first** before clicking on any other sections. In other words, if the affected sortie was 5-1 do not click on other sorties before clicking on 5-1 **after** you have clicked to some other tab first.
