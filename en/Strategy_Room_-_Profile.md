#### Admiral Info

Most of these information can also be found in your HQ page inside the game:

-   **ID:** Your unique player ID.
-   **Name:** Your chosen in-game nickname.
-   **Comment:** Your chosen comment to be shown at PvP screen, HQ page or at Ranks.
-   **Server:** The name of the server you belong to.
-   **Rank:** Your rank.
-   **Level:** Your HQ level.

#### Statistics

Most of these information is pretty straightforward. Again these can be found on your HQ page inside the game with the exception of the fact that the percentages shown are accurate to two decimal places.

<!---   **PvP: Attacked:** The amount of times you have been attacked by another player on your server.
-   **PvP: Attacked won:** The amount of times you have been attacked by another player on your server but have won.-->

#### Rank Points

This area shows you the amount of ranking points that you have gained. The aim of this is for the viewer to start counting your rank points when you press a button to start counting, to stop counting and to reset the counters.

For more information see [here](https://github.com/KC3Kai/KC3Kai/issues/122).

<!--#### Achievements

*(the idea here is just to have custom badge icons for players to screenshot and show-off)*:
- show number of Class-A medals
- **custom achievement badges:**
  - world map clearing badge
  - ex-op clear badges
  - LSC ship badges
  - monthly rank badges
  - kai ni badges. etc
  - done all daily quests badge
  - done all weekly quests badge
  - done all monthlies quest badge

*(most of these badges can be gained multiple times and will have counts)*-->
