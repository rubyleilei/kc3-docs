#Overview

Expedition Scorer presents you expeditions that are suitable based on a few factors such as:
* The amount of expeditions you have unlocked.
* The amount of fleets you have available.
* Which resources you want more over the other.
* How long you are going to be away from the gaming that you want it to be calculated upon.

Each expeditions from the uppermost part of the screen allows you to select which expeditions you want to be included in the scorer. The time it takes for each of the expeditions are shown in greyed out text.

To the far right of the expeditions listed are the amounts of fleet you have available to sortie with.

Resource Priority allows you to define how many of each of the resources you want from the expeditions given the amount of time and fleet you are planning to offer for expeditions.

AFK Time defines the amount of time you will not be there to monitor the progress of the expeditions.
