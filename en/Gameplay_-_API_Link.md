FAQ

#### I pressed some buttons within KC3 Kai frame by accident. Will I get banned?

Clicking on some buttons within KC3 Kai frame either shows you more information, resets or dismisses certain UI within KC3 Kai. KC3 Kai does not have any special permissions to arbitrarily inject packets to the game server in order to automate anything. In fact, KC3 Kai collects data passively whilst you play your game normally and presents them to you as it collects the data.
