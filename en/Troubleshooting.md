Each page of this wiki already contains Mini-FAQs on common problems per component. Please check related articles if your issue, or question is already addressed.

The following are the most common issues:

#### Q1: The page is empty

A1: You will need to play the game with the Admiral "F12" Panel open. That is the only way we can know of your in-game data. Use the Gold Heart icon on your Chrome to start playing.

#### Q2: The rate percentages under statistics are wrong

A2: Visit the in-game admiral profile screen to get the exact rates. The game has a special formula for it, not just basic percentage between the counts.

#### Q3: What is "Quick Data"?

A3: It refers to data that can be sourced from the game: ship list, equipment list, fleet arrangement, quests, map gauges, etc.

#### Q4: What encompasses "Histories"?

A4: It refers to logs saved onto the computer such as sortie history, resouce history, crafting history, etc. Clearing Histories will delete records for all accounts that played on this browser profile.

#### Q5: How will this affect my game account?

A5: **All of this does not affect your game account**, only the records and logs saved by on your computer by this extension.

#### Q6: Can I export my whole history (not just quick data) and move it to another device?

A6: Currently, no you can't fully export. However there are plans to include this into the exportable .kc3 files and will have an option for you to merge data with the target device.

There is no timeline yet for this though.
