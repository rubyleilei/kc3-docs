# Overview
The idea of Showcase is to present players with top 6 ships from each of the respective types, sorted from highest level and in descending format (ship levels lower than top 6 are omitted).

As well the four differently colored boxes on the bottom of each of the ships and their respective levels indicates their current modernization level. The colors means (in the order from left to right): Firepower, Torpedo, AA, Armor, and Luck.

In the equipment section the information displayed are usually the ones with the best stats as well as their count and the name of the equipment.

# Questions and Answers

#### Q1: Is my fleet ready?

A1: Why are you asking me? I added this page for you to easily screenshot your best shens and ask your friends or at least [on the wikia](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Board:Fleet%27s_Prepared-ness)

#### Q2: Some equipment are missing!
A2: Hm yea I noticed that, there's a ghost haunting this page. Just refresh and it will fix itself.

#### Q3: How do I screenshot?
A3: Like some others, get your smartphone and take a picture of your screen with it. topk. or just use PrintScreen button on your keyboard. You can also use [lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html), [gyazo](https://gyazo.com/), or [puush](http://puush.me/) or any preferred screenshot software. You know.

#### Q4: The top 6 here is different from the top 6 on Ship List!
A4: Those are top 6 of the same levels. We won't discuss this further. Please deal with it.

#### Q5: What are the colors and digits under each ship?
A5: Firepower, Torpedo, AA, Armor, and Luck. If it's a colored check, it's maxed. If it's a number, it how far you are from maxing it. Luck (5th number) max values are from game data, and as seen on the wikia.

#### Q6: I can't see anything!
A6: Better get your eyes checked. Oh, you mean *can't see anything on the page*? Have you played the game with F12 panel open yet? no? figures... yes? ayy lmao.

#### Q7: I want my Radars sorted by LoS!
A7: hm. sorry we can only sort one stat at a time.

#### Q8: Night scout seaplane should be on the Night gear box!
A8: Well it's listed under seaplanes on game data, leave it alone!
