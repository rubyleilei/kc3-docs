# Overview
The idea of Showcase is to present 


#### Q1: Is my fleet ready?

A1: Why are you asking me? I added this page for you to easily screenshot your best shens and ask your friends or at least [on the wikia](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Board:Fleet%27s_Prepared-ness)

#### Q2: Some equipment are missing!
A2: Hm yea I noticed that, there's a ghost haunting this page. Just refresh and it will fix itself.

#### Q3: There's no BBV, CT, AS, AR, etc!
A3: I know, and I won't add it.

**..But!**
OK fine, only BBV had it's own table! But not others since they are useless **Kamo!**

#### Q4: How do I screenshot?
A4: Like some others, get your smartphone and take a picture of your screen with it. topk. or just use PrintScreen button on your keyboard. You can also use [lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html), [gyazo](https://gyazo.com/), or [puush](http://puush.me/) or any preferred screenshot software. You know.

#### Q5: The top 6 here is different from the top 6 on Ship List!
A5: Those are top 6 of the same levels. We won't discuss this further. Please deal with it.

#### Q6: What are the colors and digits under each ship?
A6: Firepower, Torpedo, AA, Armor, and Luck. If it's a colored check, it's maxed. If it's a number, it how far you are from maxing it. Luck (5th number) max values are from game data, and as seen on the wikia.

#### Q7: I can't see anything!
A7: Better get your eyes checked. Oh, you mean *can't see anything on the page*? Have you played the game with F12 panel open yet? no? figures... yes? ayy lmao.

#### Q8: I want my Radars sorted by LoS!
A8: hm. sorry we can only sort one stat at a time.

#### Q9: Night scout seaplane should be on the Night gear box!
A9: Well it's listed under seaplanes on game data, leave it alone!

**..B-But!**
No buts
