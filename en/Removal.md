It makes us sad to see you leave, but if you really want to uninstall KC3改 from your browser, simply

1.  Go to your Chrome extensions page `chrome://extensions/`
2.  Look for **KanColle Command Center 改**
3.  Click the trash bin icon on its right

Uninstalling KC3改 **will** also clear all your history with KC3 Kai. If you re-install it, the logs such as your crafting history with KC3 Kai will be empty.

Please leave a comment in the [project home](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Dragonjet/KC3%E6%94%B9) on why you are leaving :'(
