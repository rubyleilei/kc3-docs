## FAQ

#### All my settings have reset!
Yes, we did notify everyone via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dragonjetmkii), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dragonjetmkii). Those who have read the announcement would have already saved their background images. If you didn't better search for it again.

#### Docking and Akashi Repair timers are not counting down!
If you're talking about the Natsuiro theme, the indicator together with the resupply and morale statuses, then **NO they're not countdown timers**.

#### Flyboats are not counted on ELoS!
Give us the new formula, the multiplier for flyboats and we have a deal. [See issue tracker](https://github.com/dragonjet/KC3Kai/issues/687).

#### Where are the "qualified expeditions" on Natsuiro?
Expeditions helpers and planners are generally still under construction, so just wait for it on future versions. We are fighting multiple fronts in terms of expeditions, lead by **[@Javran](https://github.com/Javran)**. Many features coming your way.

#### The support expedition power is wrong
It is based on [Shelling damage calculation](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Expedition#Shelling_damage_calculation) on the wikia. We assumed non-CV(L) are just adding pure firepower, while the special formula applies to CV(L)s. If there is a better formula, inform us by creating a [new issue on Github](https://github.com/dragonjet/KC3Kai/issues/new), or [comment on the dev blog](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Dragonjet/KC3%E6%94%B9).

#### How do I dismiss the crafting box message?
Click on either "Basic" or "Battle" tab

#### How do I see the crafting message again?
You cannot get it back once you've moved to Basic or Battle tab. Just go to the strategy room and check the equipment crafting history.

#### Activity tab is not clickable
It isn't. There's nothing there unless you do something it was subscribed to, like crafting equipment. It will auto-focus when you trigger it so there's no need for it to be clickable.

#### I don't like the troll comments on sortie history like "Kid's choice"
Disable **Troll Comments** on settings.

#### What's that new "Fit" button on the panel
It will resize your browser window to fit the game screen. You'll need to click on it multiple times though to get it right.
