## Content
#### New Features
* **Strategy Room: Aircraft**
  * List all aircraft, from fighters to seaplanes and gyros
  * Each plane has its own box, in contrast to "Equipment List" which summarizes counts
  * Each plane box has the level indicator and its chevrons
  * Player has the ability to set a name for each plane
    * This for those who want a bit of role-play, assigning your own squadron names and seeing their growth, or decline
    * The names only shows up on this page, not in-game, not on the panel
    * Shows AA capability, which is the fighter power. It will look higher if equipped on a ship because of the plane slot multiplier
    * It *can* show veteran effects to fighter capability only if the plane is "maxed" at level 7
* **Strategy Room: Shiplock Planner**
  * Shows up to five colored boxes which correspond to an in-game ship-lock
  * Shows all ships on a list. Each ship can be dragged onto a colored box
  * To release a ship from a color, click on the ship's face
  * Ships that are transparent are those already locked in-game, and cannot be removed from a colored box

## FAQ

#### [Panel] Is the combined fleet interface fixed now, and not pink and blue box?
If you're using the default theme, yes we completely removed the combined fleet mode for it. That is why we generally recommend using **Natsuiro** theme for the event.

#### [Panel] Are the predictions fixed now?
Yes, our developer @[Javran](https://github.com/Javran) has revised it multiple times, and integrated nicely by @[bamboo3250](https://github.com/bamboo3250) with the help and data from the GitHub reporters.

If you find any other inconsistency. Please [create an issue here](https://github.com/dragonjet/KC3Kai/issues/new), or if you don't have a GitHub account, [comment on the dev blog](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Dragonjet/KC3%E6%94%B9).

#### [Natsuiro Theme] What are the numbers on the bottom left of my equipment?
Those are the aircraft level.

#### [Strategy Room: Shiplock Planner]
The Shiplock Planner tab has its own mini-FAQ built in on its page. Please see that instead.


#### [Strategy Room: Aircraft] Why is the AA of some planes so high?
It considers the plane slot it is currently in, and this shows you the actual **fighter power**, and not just AA. See formula here on the wikia.

Currently, it *can* also show effects of veterancy, but currently, **only for MAX** leveled planes. That's the only formula we know, based on [aircalc.net](http://aircalc.net/) (credits to those who formulated the equations we have now).

#### [Strategy Room: Aircraft] How do I save the name after typing?
Hit Enter, or just click outside of the box. It is automatically saved without sign or warning.
