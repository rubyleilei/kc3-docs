The Quests tab presents tracking on the quests you are doing **whilst** using KC3 Kai. For more information about the quest you may want to refer to:

-   [Quests (Kancolle wikia link)](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Quests)

#### Recurring quests

Recurring quests are shown at the top along with buttons to manually reset quests (on top) as needed. As you progress on with each recurring quest(s) completed they will be marked accordingly and present to you the next quest that follows suit.

Each quests are presented with various buttons, they are as follows:
- "-" reduces the count for the selected quest.
- "+" increments the count for the selected quest.
- "►►" marks the quest as complete and proceeds to the next quest that falls in line.
- "x" Deletes the quest from the flowchart.

#### Other quests

These quests are usually one-off quests such as Marriage/Events/etc quests.

**NOTE**

-   Once the recurring quests are reset, the changes does **not** immediately take effect on the KC3 Kai panel itself.
    In order to update the KC3 Kai panel with new information you will need to run your game through the quests screen so that it picks up activated quests.
