#Overview

**Currently this feature is not working/under experimentation.**

The plan for Newsfeed is to show a history of news appearing from your game session. Whether it be fleets returning from expeditions or that you have been defeated by the rival in a PvP match held by the rival themselves.

Rather than having a maximum of five (5) entries of Newsfeed it will show the entire history.

##Questions and answers
**Question: Why doesn't it show timestamps for when I got attacked by someone in a PvP match, etc?**

Answer: This is because the game servers themselves does not provide such data to your game session much less to the viewer itself.
