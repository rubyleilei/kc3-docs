#Overview

Aircraft Proficiency has become a thing since Summer 2015 Event and therefore makes the display of the progress for the aircrafts simpler to the user as well as the plane's stats, where they are equipped, etc.

The same rule applies to equipments - if you do not have equipment under the specified category it will not show anything.

The buttons are from left to right:
* Fighter plane(s)
* Bomber(s)
* Torpedo bomber(s)
* Carrier based Reconnaissance plane(s)
* Seaplane(s) as well as Seaplane bomber(s)
* Autogyro(s)
* Type 3 Command Liasion Aircraft(s) (ASW)
* Type 2 Large-sized Flying Boat(s)

The "Unnamed Squadron" field allows you to name the individual equipments for potentially easier reference, etc.
