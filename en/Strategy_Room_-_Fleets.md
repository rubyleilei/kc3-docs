Here is where you can find an overview of your fleet setup and various information that is handy.

From left to right, top to bottom:

-   Fleet name as displayed in the top left of the "bubble" box.
-   Combined total level of that fleet
-   Old Line Of Sight (LoS) calculation
-   New Equipment Line of Sight (ELoS) calculation
-   Entire fleet's overall speed.

The next few lines describes:

-   The ship class
-   The names of those respective ship(s)
-   The currently equipped equipments on the respective ship(s)

**Note**

-   If you have (more than) one ship in your fleet that is slow. The entire fleet will be marked as slow.
-   Any changes to the ship(s) in the fleet including the ordering and/or equipments, etc **will not** be updated within KC3 Kai in real-time until you return to the main screen from within the game itself first.
